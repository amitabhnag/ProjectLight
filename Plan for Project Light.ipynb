    ">Education is a right just like right to have proper food and shelter. Education is also a passport to human development. Project Light aims to throw light upon factors affecting student performance in India\n",
    "\n",
    "In year 2000, Worlds governments adopted \"Education For All\" (EFA) resolution under the auspices of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). One of the key goals under the EFA resolution is ensuring quality of education for all children. Here quality aspect is equally important if not more important than quantity. Without quality education, the goal of EFA may be fulfilled tactically, but not in its spirit. Throwing **light** upon the factors that affect quality of education in India is the goal of Project Light. Student performance is a key indicator of quality of education. Finding factors that affect student performance can help non-profit, government and industry to focus on improving those factors and hence improving the quality of education. Choice of this project is influenced by the potential of \"social impact\", a core tenet of human centerd design. India is a developing country, home to 1.3 Billion people and 390 Million children. Due to my own experience with Indian education system, this project is focused on education in India. "

Two one hour interviews in each household covered topics concerning health, education, employment, economic status, marriage, fertility, gender relations, and social capital. IHDS was conducted in all states and union territories of India (with the exception of Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep).Short reading, writing, and arithmetic knowledge tests were administered to all available children aged 8-11 in the household.\n",

    "* ICPSR/IHDS data is very well structured; however, student data is a part of the larger human development study. As per documentation, only students aged 8-11 are covered in the performance assessment. This will limit generalizing the findings of the factors across all age groups \n",
    "* ICPSR/IHDS data does not contain direct linkages between the primary school data and the household or individual data. As per documentation a user can aggregate the school data to the PSUID (Person Unique Id) or DISTID (District Id) level and integrate them with the household or individual data to investigate the educational context of the household or individual. However, this will be an \"approximate join\". Analysis that depends upon this approximate join will need to account for this approximation    \n",
    "* ICPSR/IHDS data has two versions: 2005 and 2011. As per documentation, 2011 version is incomplete and hence 2005 survey is currently planned to be used\n",

    "* Both surveys suffer from using strict definitions of gender and does not account for LGBTQ gender categories\n",
    "* ICPSR/IHDS data has empty values for multiple columns\n",
    "* Pratham data source has lots of NAs\n",
    "* Both sources use canned survey questions. Open ended questions are desirable as they may reveal additional insights or factors that the survey designers may not have conceived \n",
